# Description
This study presents a novel model of the Martian crustal magnetic field, derived from magnetic field data acquired by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN), and the orbiter of Tianwen-1 mission. 
The model is constructed using the Equivalent Source Dipole (ESD) method, with dipole sources uniformly distributed on a spherical surface according to the Fibonacci Sphere Distribution. 
The inversion of the magnetic dipole moments involves two key steps. First, the radial components of the magnetic dipole moments are inverted using only the radial magnetic observations. 
Subsequently, the inverted radial magnetic moments serve as the initial model to derive the three-component magnetic moments through the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) method with Huber weight. 
Our inversion scheme is designed to minimize non-uniqueness and reduce the influence of external magnetic sources. 
The inverted magnetic dipole moments are transformed into a spherical harmonic model, which demonstrates convergence of the magnetic power spectrum at the surface of Mars up to spherical harmonic degree 110. 
The predicted values from our model are compared with on-site magnetic measurements taken by the InSight lander and the Zhurong Rover of the Tianwen-1 mission. 
The results show qualitative agreement with these observations at the landing sites, supporting the robustness of our model which is derived from orbital magnetic data.
